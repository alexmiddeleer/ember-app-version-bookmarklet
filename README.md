# ember-app-version-bookmarklet
Bookmarklet to show ember app version info quickly (no need to open dev tools > ember inspector > info)

Just update the APP_NAME_REGEX and APP_NAME constants to something reasonable (see ember inspector info tab) and paste it into the url field of a bookmark. Tested in modern versions of chrome; you may need to delete newline characters in some browsers.

PR's and feedback are welcome!
